 
# Algebra with Python<p>
This syllabus is the full course, designed as a one-semester college course, with all of the links and resources you need listed here in order. Most of this course will involve videos and Google Colaboratory notebooks. As you go throught each part of this course in sequence, watching each video and working through each Colab notebook, you will gain a full understanding of Algebra and how to write Python code to solve your Algebra problems. Throughout this course, you will also build your own Algebra notebook that you will be able to use as your custom super calculator. This course (and the code you write here) will give you the foundation for deeper math, including data science.<p>

## Week 12 - Business Applications<p>
This unit will show you how to apply your solving and graphing skills to find cost, revenue, and profit. You will write code to develop a demand function from two points. You will see how price affects the profit graph and how all of these equations relate to each other.<p>
[video 26](https://www.youtube.com/embed/8PIZmiMFmfk)<p>
 
Question:<br>

## Week 13 - Simple and Compound Interest<p>
This unit will show you how to calculate interest, loan payments, and the estimated value of investments. You will see the math formula and turn that into code. Because these formulas tend to get complicated, you will appreciate having the code where you can just modify a few values. First, you will get to understand the equations and what it all means.<p>

Question:
In percent increase formulas, what does the "principle" refer to?<br>
__ the main amount<br>
__ the ending amount<br>
__ the starting amount<br>
__ the (1 + rate) multiplier<br>

### Project 4 - Build a Financial Calculator
 
Your calculator should do the following:<br>
<ul>
<li>Calculate annuity with monthly or continuous growth</li>
<li>Calculate monthly mortgage payment</li>
<li>Estimate retirement investment balance</li>
<li>Determine how long until an amount doubles, given the rate</li>
<li>Solve logarithmic equations</li>
<li>Convert to (and from) scientific notation</li>
</ul>

## Week 15 - Conclusion and Additional Resources<p>
This will be the last unit in this course. Let's look at how you can connect your Math and Python knowledge with external data. This video will show you how to get data from other sources, then transform it so that you can graph it and interpret it:<p>
[video 32 - graphing external data](https://www.youtube.com/embed/JH9Uk2mi3Dc)<p>
 
Question:<br>
What library helps you to read data from a .csv and store it as a dataframe where you can select columns?<br>
__ Math<br>
__ Pandas<br>
__ Data<br>
__ Matplotlib<br>
<br>

One more thing... This brief video will show you some of the resources available to you in Google Colab notebooks. <p>
[video 33](https://www.youtube.com/embed/HNFrRHqpck4)<p>
 
Question:<br>
Which code snippets are available in the Google Colaboratory?<br>
__ Camera capture<br>

 ### Project 5 - Build a Data Graph Explorer
 
 Your script should do the following:<br>
<ul>
<li>Get a .csv file in three ways<br>
 - uploading it from the local computer<br>
 - getting a url from user input<br>
 - putting the url in the code<br>
</li>
<li>Use the Pandas library to save the .csv as a dataframe</li>
<li>Print headings and the first two rows</li>
<li>Store the column names as a list</li>
<li>Choose one or two columns and convert the data to Numpy arrays</li>
<li>Display data as a scatter plot or a line graph</li>
<li>Be able to do this for different column combinations, and interpret the graphs</li>
</ul>
<p>
<hr>
<p>

### Your homemade Python Math notebook 
Put all of your projects, and any other functions or formulas you want, into one Colab notebook. Be sure to make sections with headings so that you have a table of contents. Now you understand the math and the code, and you have a resource that you built. Use it to solve problems, graph data, and calculate anything you want.
<p>

<p>

 
The next course will build upon the skills you learned here. You will learn more ways to get data and more mathematical operations to transform and analyze that data in different ways. Continue to build your personal Colab notebook, adding new formulas and functions.<p>
